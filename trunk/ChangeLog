  - updated GtkamlCompiler with latest ValaCompiler changes (create a .patch)
  - check my version against source version and issue a warning

2008-03-02

2008-03-02
  - finished adding default values to *.implicits
  - fixed vala-0.1.7 compile errors


2008-02-28
  - renamed gtkaml:reference to gtkaml:existing
  - introduced gtkaml:standalone

2008-02-21
  - added gtkaml:implements
  - allow hyphen-separated attributes
  - adding ImplicitsStore to resolve symbols from multiple *.implicits files

2008-02-20
  - changed gtkaml:construct and preconstruct behaviour to match signals'

2008-02-11
  - added support for gtkaml:construct and gtkaml:preconstruct attrs
    Construct goes after all the children have been added, and
    preconstruct goes right before the element has been created 
    (or, in the case of root, right before setting the minimum
    attributes of the base creation method)

2008-02-10
  - bumped version to 0.2.0.0
  - removed dependency between SAXParser and CodeGenerator (moved
    the parse/resolve/generate 'process' in Gtkaml.Parser)
  - enforced specifying the constructor parameters for the root tag

2008-02-08
  - fixed a segfault where a g_strjoinv () was called without a last NULL
  - fixed bug with signals handling that missed most parameters

2008-02-06
  - added TreeViewColumn 'adds' in implicits.ini  
	- added reference tags (see goals for 0.2)	
	- changed ',' into ';' in implicits.ini for TreeView

2008-02-05
gtkaml 0.1.1.0 release
	- added the Gtk.MenuItem in implicits.ini with 'new' parameter 'label'
	- fixed an issue when loooking up for constructor parameters' type
	- fixed a bug (#1) which prevented a widget from a namespace to be 
	  added into a container from another namespace (and viceversa)
	- fixed an issue (#2) with gtkaml:name and gtkaml:namespace added as
	  properties of this
	- removed the signal that caused a vala crash from example0

2008-02-03	
gtkaml 0.1.0.1 release
	- configure.ac now specifies the real required version of vala (>= 0.1.6)
	- examples are not installed in bin anymoer
	- C source for examples is not provided (is generated by gtkaml + vala)


2008-02-02: 
gtkaml 0.1 release
	- gtkaml:name and gtkaml:namespace for specifying the resulting class name/namespace
	- the gtkaml namespace name is considered the one with the URI starting with "http://gtkaml.org" 
	  (e.g. you can use xmlns:class="http://gtkaml.org" and then 
	- 'complex' attributes: tags that have the name of an attribute of the parent tag are used to 
	  specify complex widget values (e.g. tab_label parameter of add_page ())
	- 'simple' attributes as tags - the CDATA or text content is the literal;
	
2008-02-01
Rewrite:
	- finished rewrite so that we resolve the constructors and add methods for all widget tree, 
	  and _then_ render all the source
	- you can now use the name of a constructor as a boolean attribute to force using it 
	  (e.g. with_mnemonic="true"). Otherwise, one is chosen for you
	- the same with add methods: specify pack_start="true" on children of a Box 
	  and you are prompted to enter the parameters
	- signals are assigned ad-literam if the expression is in between {}

2008-01-29
Added:
	- signals (always wrapped in a lambda function)
	- attributes from the whole hierarchy
	- examples/ added to project

2008-01-25
Generates the following:
	- private/public data members
	- blank constructors calls
	- sets attributes (only from the direct class, not inherited ones): 
	  properies and fields.
