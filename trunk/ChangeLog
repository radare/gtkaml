Rewrite:
	- finished rewrite so that we resolve the constructors and add methods for all widget tree, 
	  and _then_ render all the source
	- you can now use the name of a constructor as a boolean attribute to force using it 
	  (e.g. with_mnemonic="true"). Otherwise, one is chosen for you
	- the same with add methods: specify pack_start="true" on children of a Box 
	  and you are prompted to enter the parameters
	- signals are assigned ad-literam if the expression is in between {}

2008-02-01: 0.1 RC1
	- gtkaml:name and gtkaml:namespace for specifying the resulting class name/namespace
	- the gtkaml namespace name is considered the one with the URI starting with "http://gtkaml.org" 
	  (e.g. you can use xmlns:class="http://gtkaml.org" and then 
	- 'complex' attributes: tags that have the name of an attribute of the parent tag are used to 
	  specify complex widget values (e.g. tab_label parameter of add_page ())
	- 'simple' attributes as tags - the CDATA or text content is the literal;
